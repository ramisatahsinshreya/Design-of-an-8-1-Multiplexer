# Design-of-an-8-1-Multiplexer
This project focused on simplifying circuit complexity and reducing power consumption, making our multiplexer ideal for
biomedical and data acquisition systems. Key features include a low ON resistance of 10 ohms and the use of CMOS transmission
gate logic, which allows bidirectional signal flow, wide voltage compatibility, and minimal cross-talk. Operating at a 3V DC supply
ensures efficient power management.
